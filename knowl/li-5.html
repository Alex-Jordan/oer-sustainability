<div class="para">As an OER evolves, new versions come into existence. While some faculty use a new version, other faculty may need to continue using an old version (either for curriculum reasons or the burden of updating secondary materials may be too high). And so we reach a point where multiple versions of a single OER are in use, and management of versions is needed.</div>
<div class="para">This creates logistical issues for managing an OER. Logistical issues may be scoped to an individual instructor, a group of PCC colleagues, an entire SAC, or to include external colleagues.</div>
<div class="para">For example if an OER is for print and printed through the PCC print center, it has a job number. If it is then sold through the book store, it has an ISBN. These numbers are necessarily different for each version of an OER. Within a SAC, there can be confusion about which job numbers and ISBNs should be used, which are outdated, which are for a certain instructor only, etc.</div>
<div class="para">Similar concerns exist with proliferation of an OER across D2L course shells. In SACs where there is no SAC management of D2L template shells, faculty lose track of where they have made meaningful improvements to an OER and how they could propagate good changes along for other faculty.</div>
<div class="para">If an external OER is used, it can change our from under PCC faculty without warning, and without maintaining access to the previous version. Even when there is not a concern about content changing in a meaningful way, the sudden breaking of links and references in PCC materials is a concern.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#li-5" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
