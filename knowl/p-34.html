<li><div class="para">Encourage SACs to use D2L root course shells managed at the SAC level. New D2L shells would be copied from the SAC root shell, not from an instructor’s prior shell. (Train faculty to copy personalized components from their prior shells instead.) Foster a culture of bringing improvements upstream to the SAC root shell.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">An “OER coordinator” position for a SAC or for a collection of related SACs. For example the MTH SAC has a coordinator for online courses, for student advising, and for assessment; and these positions come with course release and defined responsibilities. A coordinator could manage OER-based SAC root D2L shells, print center order numbers, ISBNs, a faculty reference page, questions from faculty about all things OER, and executing some of the SAC’s needs for routine maintenance.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Fund PT faculty labor that goes toward OER maintenance.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Survey small SACs where OER is in use (or where the SAC would like to start using it) and weigh this into decisions about where to hire more FT faculty and what skills should be included in the job search.</div></li>
