<div class="para">There’s a lot of OER, but no department-wide requirement to use the same thing. There’s a lot of freedom. Many things are made, sometimes doubled up for the same course. Teachers make downstream edits, but then how do people know which version is whose version? Where is everything? How do I get it? Which version should I use? It’s frustrating to update something and find other faculty are still using old versions.</div> <div class="para">Print center job numbers and ISBNs are a challenge. Adopting faculty come to you with questions about “your” OER even when they are really asking about a derivative work a few generations removed. They might just have a logistical question like how to order through the bookstore.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Tim Krause, ESOL</cite>
