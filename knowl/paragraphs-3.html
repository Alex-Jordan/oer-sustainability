<div class="para">We use Pressbooks, Google Docs, slides, a webpage linking to 100 different documents, D2L shells. It’s all over the place because of the nature of the course. Ancillaries are difficult to corral: audio files, video files, etc.</div> <div class="para">In our SAC, PressBooks is not good for workbooks. Google Docs is easier. But then the Goolge Docs are difficult to manage, especially downstream with derivative works.</div> <div class="para">H5P in Pressbooks is great but we can’t print those exercises. Pressbooks is structured tightly (for accessibility) so not much freedom for layout/non-linear progression. Some materials are presently digital only, which can become an equity issue.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Tim Krause, ESOL</cite>

<div class="para">We teaching from D2L, but all the links for the OER point to Google Docs. Every time there was a simple thing to change, had to be done in D2L and in Google. D2L was barrier because we couldn’t share the OER across instructors easily.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Rachelle Katter, HE</cite>
