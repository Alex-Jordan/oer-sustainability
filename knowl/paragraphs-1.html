<div class="para">We would like to have a three year timeline with scheduled OER revision. We need maintenance for current events, new science, new nutrition information, etc.  I was 100% all in to OER, but I wouldn’t do it again because it’s such a burden. Particularly form scratch, but even an adaptation. The startup funding happens, but then you have this responsibility to keep it going through volunteerism.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN</cite>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">An obstacle now to creating something new is awareness of this maintenance issue. In our SAC, some content is changing on an ongoing basis as time and knowledge evolves. Neuroscience for example is always changing. Human development and Intro Psych are undergoing pedagogical upheaval for a few reasons.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Debi Cozzoli, PSY</cite>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">Our SAC created an OER with an early OpenOregon grant. But maintenance is where it fell apart. Health information changes frequently, and there are frequent needs to update content because of new information. Now only one instructor still using it.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Rachelle Katter, HE</cite>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">This year our OER reading list needed to be updated. Students signed up for a section of the reading list, checked links, checked accessibility, and give feedback about content. These student presentations gave us lots of feedback, but now it will take lots of hours to make revisions. And his kind of revision really should be annual or every other year.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Taryn Oakley, ESR</cite>
