<div class="para">People feel unsure if they have ownership over making changes. Faculty do not understand licensing well either. And the design of some OER can feel limiting to faculty who want to change things. Projects are in a format that is hard to edit and does not always upload well to other platforms (especially H5P items). Doing any maintenance requires detailing what you want done, and sending that work order to someone outside your SAC who works with STORI, OL, etc.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN</cite>
