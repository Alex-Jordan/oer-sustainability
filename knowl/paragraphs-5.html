<div class="para">There’s a lot of OER, but no department-wide requirement to use the same thing. There’s a lot of freedom. Many things are made, sometimes doubled up for the same course. Teachers make downstream edits, but then how do people know which version is whose version? Where is everything? How do I get it? Which version should I use? It’s frustrating to update something and find other faculty are still using old versions.</div> <div class="para">Print center job numbers and ISBNs are a challenge. Adopting faculty come to you with questions about “your” OER even when they are really asking about a derivative work a few generations removed. They might just have a logistical question like how to order through the bookstore.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Tim Krause, ESOL</cite>

<div class="para">Instructor to instructor, they choose independently how to deliver the OER. We had issues with new faculty needing help getting started with the OER. Now we’ve each settled in our ways, but separately. (We aren’t able to bring improvements back to each other’s versions.)</div> <cite class="attribution">―Debi Cozzoli, PSY</cite>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">New versions of any OER for print that go through the PCC print center require a new print center job number. If the print copy is then also sold through the bookstore, it needs a new ISBN. Managing all of these order numbers and ISBNs can be a challenge. If it’s not managed well, you might find an instructor is still ordering print copies of an outdated version from some previous year.</div> <cite class="attribution">―Alex Jordan, MTH</cite>
