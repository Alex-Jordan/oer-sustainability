  "body": "   Alex Jordan  Cascade Math Department  Portland Community College        During Spring term 2023, I interviewed PCC faculty in Math, ESOL, Food & Nutrition, Chemistry, Psychology, Health Studies, and Environmental Studies to learn about their concerns with maintainiing OER projects used by their SAC. This report summarizes their concerns and recommendations for addressing the problems. Data about the impact of these OER programs is prresented.  We assume readers already appreciate the sizable positive impact that OER use has on PCC students and we do not try to make that argument here. Please contact Jen Klaudinyu ( jen.klaudinyi@pcc.edu ) for questions about the impact of OER at PCC.   "

  "title": "Primary Concerns",
  "body": " Primary Concerns  Faculty concerns fell into five broad categories, summarized here.   Routine Curriculum Updates  OER projects present course materials to students. In some disciplines, course materials become outdated quickly, and need to be revised frequently (in some cases annually). Other subject areas (and courses within subject areas) also need regular revision, even when the subject itself is stable. This keeps examples current and recognizes areas to make the content more culturally relevant.    Making Use of New Technologies  Some OER projects should take advantage of new technology methods that become available. For example a new interactive H5P widget could be a more effective learning device to display some data compared with using just a static picture. Or there might be a new way to integrate the OER with D2L.    Wrangling Current Technologies  Some support tools that currently host OER (Google Docs, Pressbooks, D2L, and more) introduce an unmanageable workload when faculty attempt to update OER. Especially if they are hoping to update it in a way that makes the improvements easy to share.    Special Expertise  Sometimes OER is created or stored using technologies that typical faculty are unable to work with. Faculty would like to improve the OER, but have to work through a bottleneck of accessing the few (or one) person at PCC who has the technical skills to make those changes. The people with that technical expertise may not have curricular expertiese, complicating the collaboration.    Logistical Concerns  As an OER evolves, new versions come into existence. While some faculty use a new version, other faculty may need to continue using an old version (either for curriculum reasons or the burden of updating secondary materials may be too high). And so we reach a point where multiple versions of a single OER are in use, and management of versions is needed.  This creates logistical issues for managing an OER. Logistical issues may be scoped to an individual instructor, a group of PCC colleagues, an entire SAC, or to include external colleagues.  For example if an OER is for print and printed through the PCC print center, it has a job number. If it is then sold through the book store, it has an ISBN. These numbers are necessarily different for each version of an OER. Within a SAC, there can be confusion about which job numbers and ISBNs should be used, which are outdated, which are for a certain instructor only, etc.  Similar concerns exist with proliferation of an OER across D2L course shells. In SACs where there is no SAC management of D2L template shells, faculty lose track of where they have made meaningful improvements to an OER and how they could propagate good changes along for other faculty.  If an external OER is used, it can change our from under PCC faculty without warning, and without maintaining access to the previous version. Even when there is not a concern about content changing in a meaningful way, the sudden breaking of links and references in PCC materials is a concern.     "

  "title": "Paraphrased Interviews",
  "body": " Paraphrased Interviews   Here are some statements made by PCC faculty during an interview about OER sustainability. None of these are direct quotations, since interview notes were only taken in shorthand.          Routine Curriculum Updates   We would like to have a three year timeline with scheduled OER revision. We need maintenance for current events, new science, new nutrition information, etc. I was 100% all in to OER, but I wouldn't do it again because it's such a burden. Particularly form scratch, but even an adaptation. The startup funding happens, but then you have this responsibility to keep it going through volunteerism.  Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN    An obstacle now to creating something new is awareness of this maintenance issue. In our SAC, some content is changing on an ongoing basis as time and knowledge evolves. Neuroscience for example is always changing. Human development and Intro Psych are undergoing pedagogical upheaval for a few reasons.  Debi Cozzoli, PSY    Our SAC created an OER with an early OpenOregon grant. But maintenance is where it fell apart. Health information changes frequently, and there are frequent needs to update content because of new information. Now only one instructor still using it.  Rachelle Katter, HE    This year the OER reading lists needed to be updated. Students signed up for a section of the reading list, checked links, checked accessibility, and give feedback about content. These student presentations gave us lots of feedback, but now it will take lots of hours to make revisions. And this kind of revision really should be annual or every other year.  Taryn Oakley, ESR     Making Use of New Technologies   SAC shells would make it easier to propagate improvements and take burden off of PT faculty, but we don't have enough FT faculty to take that on. There should be one FT faculty responsible for each SAC shell.  Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN    Accessibility needs and cultural responsiveness grow with time. Our Our OER is not currently in a printable form. How will we provide this to Coffee Creek without a new platform?  Rachelle Katter, HE    All the various math OERs would benefit significantly from folding in more interactive elements to help students learn as they read. Each one takes time and labor to prototype and deploy, and we are years behind where we could be.  Alex Jordan, MTH     Wrangling Current Technologies   We use Pressbooks, Google Docs, slides, a webpage linking to 100 different documents, D2L shells. It's all over the place because of the nature of the course. Ancillaries are difficult to corral: audio files, video files, etc.  In our SAC, PressBooks is not good for workbooks. Google Docs is easier. But then the Goolge Docs are difficult to manage, especially downstream with derivative works.  H5P in Pressbooks is great but we can't print those exercises. Pressbooks is structured tightly (for accessibility) so not much freedom for layout\/non-linear progression. Some materials are presently digital only, which can become an equity issue.  Tim Krause, ESOL    We teaching from D2L, but all the links for the OER point to Google Docs. Every time there was a simple thing to change, had to be done in D2L and in Google. D2L was barrier because we couldn't share the OER across instructors easily.  Rachelle Katter, HE     Technology Expertise   People feel unsure if they have ownership over making changes. Faculty do not understand licensing well either. And the design of some OER can feel limiting to faculty who want to change things. Projects are in a format that is hard to edit and does not always upload well to other platforms (especially H5P items). Doing any maintenance requires detailing what you want done, and sending that work order to someone outside your SAC who works with STORI, OL, etc.  Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN    We have videos and embeddings created in collaboration with someone in OL and STORI. But the videos needed updating, and there were some issue on back end, and we needed that person (rather than anyone in our own SAC) for.  Ken Friedrick, CH    Many MTH OERs are based in a publishing tool called PreTeXt and manage versions with a tool called git . Only a few SAC members know how to work with PreTeXt and git .  Alex Jordan, MTH     Logistical Concerns   There's a lot of OER, but no department-wide requirement to use the same thing. There's a lot of freedom. Many things are made, sometimes doubled up for the same course. Teachers make downstream edits, but then how do people know which version is whose version? Where is everything? How do I get it? Which version should I use? It's frustrating to update something and find other faculty are still using old versions.  Print center job numbers and ISBNs are a challenge. Adopting faculty come to you with questions about your OER even when they are really asking about a derivative work a few generations removed. They might just have a logistical question like how to order through the bookstore.  Tim Krause, ESOL    We need a culture of reporting improvements upstream.  Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN    Instructor to instructor, they choose independently how to deliver the OER. We had issues with new faculty needing help getting started with the OER. Now we've each settled in our ways, but separately. (We aren't able to bring improvements back to each other's versions.)  Debi Cozzoli, PSY    New versions of any OER for print that go through the PCC print center require a new print center job number. If the print copy is then also sold through the bookstore, it needs a new ISBN. Managing all of these order numbers and ISBNs can be a challenge. If it's not managed well, you might find an instructor is still ordering print copies of an outdated version from some previous year.  Alex Jordan, MTH    "

  "title": "Suggestions",
  "body": " Suggestions   Combining input from several interviewees, here are some suggestions for PCC administration and SACs to address obstacles to OER maintenance.      Encourage SACs to use D2L root course shells managed at the SAC level. New D2L shells would be copied from the SAC root shell, not from an instructor's prior shell. (Train faculty to copy personalized components from their prior shells instead.) Foster a culture of bringing improvements upstream to the SAC root shell.    An OER coordinator position for a SAC or for a collection of related SACs. For example the MTH SAC has a coordinator for online courses, for student advising, and for assessment; and these positions come with course release and defined responsibilities. A coordinator could manage OER-based SAC root D2L shells, print center order numbers, ISBNs, a faculty reference page, questions from faculty about all things OER, and executing some of the SAC's needs for routine maintenance.    Fund PT faculty labor that goes toward OER maintenance.    Survey small SACs where OER is in use (or where the SAC would like to start using it) and weigh this into decisions about where to hire more FT faculty and what skills should be included in the job search.
