        <p>
          During Spring term 2023, I interviewed PCC faculty in Math, ESOL, Food &amp; Nutrition,
          Chemistry, Psychology, Health Studies, and Environmental Studies to learn about their
          concerns with maintainiing OER projects used by their SAC. This report summarizes their
          concerns and recommendations for addressing the problems. Data about the impact of these
          OER programs is prresented.
        </p>
        <p>
          We assume readers already appreciate the sizable positive impact that OER use has on PCC
          students and we do not try to make that argument here. Please contact Jen Klaudinyu
          (<email>jen.klaudinyi@pcc.edu</email>) for questions about the impact of OER at PCC.
