  <title>Suggestions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Combining input from several interviewees, here are some suggestions for PCC administration
      and SACs to address obstacles to OER maintenance.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encourage SACs to use D2L root course shells managed at the SAC level. New D2L shells
          would be copied from the SAC root shell, not from an instructor's prior shell. (Train
          faculty to copy personalized components from their prior shells instead.) Foster a culture
          of bringing improvements upstream to the SAC root shell.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An <q>OER coordinator</q> position for a SAC or for a collection of related SACs. For
          example the MTH SAC has a coordinator for online courses, for student advising, and for
          assessment; and these positions come with course release and defined responsibilities. A
          coordinator could manage OER-based SAC root D2L shells, print center order numbers, ISBNs,
          a faculty reference page, questions from faculty about all things OER, and executing some
          of the SAC's needs for routine maintenance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Fund labor that goes toward OER maintenance. See <xref ref="section-3"/> for a
          quantification of the need.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Survey small SACs where OER is in use (or where the SAC would like to start using it) and
          weigh this into decisions about where to hire more FT faculty and what skills should be
          included in the job search.
        </p>

    </ol>
