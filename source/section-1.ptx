  <title>Primary Concerns</title>
  <p>
    Faculty concerns fell into five broad categories, summarized here.
    <dl width="narrow">
      <li>
        <title>Routine Curriculum Updates</title>
        <p>
          OER projects present course materials to students. In some disciplines, course materials
          become outdated quickly, and need to be revised frequently (in some cases annually). Other
          subject areas (and courses within subject areas) also need regular revision, even when the
          subject itself is stable. This keeps examples current and recognizes areas to make the
          content more culturally relevant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Making Use of New Technologies</title>
        <p>
          Some OER projects should take advantage of new technology methods that become available.
          For example a new interactive H5P widget could be a more effective learning device to
          display some data compared with using just a static picture. Or there might be a new way
          to integrate the OER with D2L.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Wrangling Current Technologies</title>
        <p>
          Some support tools that currently host OER (Google Docs, Pressbooks, D2L, and more) 
          introduce an unmanageable workload when faculty attempt to update OER. Especially if they
          are hoping to update it in a way that makes the improvements easy to share.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Special Expertise</title>
        <p>
          Sometimes OER is created or stored using technologies that typical faculty are unable to
          work with. Faculty would like to improve the OER, but have to work through a bottleneck
          of accessing the few (or one) person at PCC who has the technical skills to make those
          changes. The people with that technical expertise may not have curricular expertiese,
          complicating the collaboration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Logistical Concerns</title>
        <p>
          As an OER evolves, new versions come into existence. While some faculty use a new version,
          other faculty may need to continue using an old version (either for curriculum reasons or
          the burden of updating secondary materials may be too high). And so we reach a point where
          multiple versions of a single OER are in use, and management of versions is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This creates logistical issues for managing an OER. Logistical issues may be scoped to an
          individual instructor, a group of PCC colleagues, an entire SAC, or to include external
          colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example if an OER is for print and printed through the PCC print center, it has a job
          number. If it is then sold through the book store, it has an ISBN. These numbers are
          necessarily different for each version of an OER. Within a SAC, there can be confusion
          about which job numbers and ISBNs should be used, which are outdated, which are for a
          certain instructor only, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar concerns exist with proliferation of an OER across D2L course shells. In SACs
          where there is no SAC management of D2L template shells, faculty lose track of where they
          have made meaningful improvements to an OER and how they could propagate good changes
          along for other faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an external OER is used, it can change our from under PCC faculty without warning, and
          without maintaining access to the previous version. Even when there is not a concern about
          content changing in a meaningful way, the sudden breaking of links and references in PCC
          materials is a concern.
