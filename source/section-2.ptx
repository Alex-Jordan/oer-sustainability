  <title>Paraphrased Interviews</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Here are some statements made by PCC faculty during an interview about OER sustainability.
      None of these are direct quotations, since interview notes were only taken in shorthand.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <!-- 
  SUGGESTIONS Tim Krause
  Centralize around one-stop shopping place; not around common materials though
  Wish list: take on assigning ISBNs
  Central place at PCC to manage these OER libraries
  Need for labor to keep things up to date; no plans at this time but aware of the upcoming need
  Answering questions about how to use materials is already a lot of labor
 -->

 <!-- LABOR Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza
 Instructors use Announcements page to bring in new content because it is too hard to update the actual content
 Use a variety of media in the content, keeping links up to date is labor
 Have SAC shells, but it is natural to use your own shell from last term because you customized...
 Wonder how much training with D2L could help
 100% all in to OER, but I wouldn't do it again because it's such a burden. Particularly form scratch, but even an adaptation. The startup funding happens, but then you have this responsibility to keep it going through volunteerism.
 -->

 <!-- SUGGESTIONS/LABOR Ken Friedrich
Mike Mackel LibreText combining sources
WeBWorK support for that course
Recent expansion of who is using it
Stephanie and Lee helps with WeBWorK issues
Maintenance with the WeBWorK library falls on Lee
Matt (temporary dean) is providing hours for Lee
Every time, Ken mentions OER maintenance and the need for sustainable support
0.162 release for the CH 151 LibreText
 -->

<!-- Deb Cozzoli
Faculty all have to do their own bookstore orders  
On a 4-year cycle, one 0.333 FTE release for a potential neuroscience OER
Special project rate is not much pay and doesn't free up time
-->

<!-- Rachelle Katter
Try to do solid updates every other year
Built in Google folder
Other classes also have OER, more manageable because fewer instructors involved
Use OER in the courses with fewer students as a consequence
The high volume courses aren't using OER, could be saving students a lot
SAC members *want* to use OER but these issues are stopping it
Only 5 FT faculty
PT don't get paid for helping with the OER maintenance
HE 250 0.33 course release, or two people with 0.25, or comparable pay for PT per 2 years
Similar needs for labor with the smaller volume courses
OER format: built into D2L as links to articles, curent news, peer reviewed research, YouTube videos, podcasts, 
Can't get the stuff out of our D2L to another school
Applying for OpenOregon grant for HE 242 (Stress and Human Health)
--> 

<!-- Taryn Oakley
only user of OER on regular basis as textbook replacement
ESR 171,2,3 (intro level not major lab course)
choice of commercial or free reading list
follows topics in book, sourced out to free sources
some students want book all in one place, get commerical
reading list is Google Doc
0.25 FTE release every other year
-->

    <title>Routine Curriculum Updates</title>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We would like to have a three year timeline with scheduled OER revision. We need maintenance
        for current events, new science, new nutrition information, etc.  I was 100% all in to OER,
        but I wouldn't do it again because it's such a burden. Particularly form scratch, but even
        an adaptation. The startup funding happens, but then you have this responsibility to keep it
        going through volunteerism.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        An obstacle now to creating something new is awareness of this maintenance issue. In our
        SAC, some content is changing on an ongoing basis as time and knowledge evolves.
        Neuroscience for example is always changing. Human development and Intro Psych are
        undergoing pedagogical upheaval for a few reasons.      
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Our SAC created an OER with an early OpenOregon grant. But maintenance is where it fell
        apart. Health information changes frequently, and there are frequent needs to update content
        because of new information. Now only one instructor still using it.

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This year the OER reading lists needed to be updated. Students signed up for a section of
        the reading list, checked links, checked accessibility, and give feedback about content.
        These student presentations gave us lots of feedback, but now it will take lots of hours to
        make revisions. And this kind of revision really should be annual or every other year.

    <title>Making Use of New Technologies</title>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        SAC shells would make it easier to propagate improvements and take burden off of PT faculty,
        but we don't have enough FT faculty to take that on. There should be one FT faculty
        responsible for each SAC shell.
      </p>
      <attribution>Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Accessibility needs and cultural responsiveness grow with time. Our Our OER is not currently
        in a printable form. How will we provide this to Coffee Creek without a new platform?
      </p>
      <attribution>Rachelle Katter, HE</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        All the various math OERs would benefit significantly from folding in more interactive
        elements to help students learn as they read. Each one takes time and labor to prototype and
        deploy, and we are years behind where we could be.

    <title>Wrangling Current Technologies</title>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We use Pressbooks, Google Docs, slides, a webpage linking to 100 different documents, D2L
        shells. It's all over the place because of the nature of the course. Ancillaries are
        difficult to corral: audio files, video files, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our SAC, PressBooks is not good for workbooks. Google Docs is easier. But then the
        Goolge Docs are difficult to manage, especially downstream with derivative works.
      </p>
      <p>
        H5P in Pressbooks is great but we can't print those exercises. Pressbooks is structured
        tightly (for accessibility) so not much freedom for layout/non-linear progression. Some
        materials are presently digital only, which can become an equity issue.      
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We teaching from D2L, but all the links for the OER point to Google Docs. Every time there
        was a simple thing to change, had to be done in D2L and in Google. D2L was barrier because
        we couldn't share the OER across instructors easily.

    <title>Technology Expertise</title>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        People feel unsure if they have ownership over making changes. Faculty do not understand
        licensing well either. And the design of some OER can feel limiting to faculty who want to
        change things. Projects are in a format that is hard to edit and does not always upload well
        to other platforms (especially H5P items). Doing any maintenance requires detailing what you
        want done, and sending that work order to someone outside your SAC who works with STORI, OL,
        etc.
      </p>
      <attribution>Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We have videos and embeddings created in collaboration with someone in OL and STORI. But
        the videos needed updating, and there were some issue on back end, and we needed that person
        (rather than anyone in our own SAC) for.

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Many MTH OERs are based in a publishing tool called <pretext/> and manage versions with a
        tool called <c>git</c>. Only a few SAC members know how to work with <pretext/> and
        <c>git</c>.

    <title>Logistical Concerns</title>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There's a lot of OER, but no department-wide requirement to use the same thing.
        There's a lot of freedom. Many things are made, sometimes doubled up for the same course.
        Teachers make downstream edits, but then how do people know which version is whose version?
        Where is everything? How do I get it? Which version should I use? It's frustrating to
        update something and find other faculty are still using old versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Print center job numbers and ISBNs are a challenge. Adopting faculty come to you with
        questions about <q>your</q> OER even when they are really asking about a derivative work a
        few generations removed. They might just have a logistical question like how to order
        through the bookstore.
      </p>
      <attribution>Tim Krause, ESOL</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We need a culture of reporting improvements upstream.
      </p>
      <attribution>Deb Lippoldt and Heather Garza, FN</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Instructor to instructor, they choose independently how to deliver the OER. We had issues
        with new faculty needing help getting started with the OER. Now we've each settled in our
        ways, but separately. (We aren't able to bring improvements back to each other's versions.)
      </p>
      <attribution>Debi Cozzoli, PSY</attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        New versions of any OER for print that go through the PCC print center require a new print
        center job number. If the print copy is then also sold through the bookstore, it needs a new
        ISBN. Managing all of these order numbers and ISBNs can be a challenge. If it's not managed
        well, you might find an instructor is still ordering print copies of an outdated version
        from some previous year.
